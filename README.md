iTunes U Feedmanager (v2)

This is the public OpenSource version of the iTunes U Feedmanager by Benjamin Graf.

This is an "app" for the CakePHP framework. To install, you have to install cakephp, install the contents of this repository into the app directory, install getID3 in Vendors/, create a sqlite3-database file (see Config/database.php.default) and create a bootstrap.php and a feedmanager.php from the .default-files. In case I forgot something here, make sure to tell me about it!

For documentation read Feedmanager-Dokumentation-public.pdf and Feedmanager-Dokumentation-v2.pdf.

All code and documentation was created at the Institute for Music Informatics and Musicology at the University of Music Karlsruhe.
